# Laboratory Experience
*Undergraduate Researcher | Dr. Feng Cancer Research Lab @ UC San Diego*
- Replicated a tumorigenic index utilizing R, RNA-seq and bioinformatic data analyses to quantify tumorigenic signal strengths and predict the disease status and tumor stages of HCC patients
    - Extracted RNA from mouse liver tissues using QIAGEN RNeasy columns to create mouse models with hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis
    - Performed RNA-seq using the multiplex analysis of polyA-linked sequence and the Illumina Hiseq2000 machine
    - Implemented STAR alignment tool to map raw reads generated by RNA-seq experiments to the mm9 mouse reference genome
    - Obtained the expression level of each gene under different conditions using cuffdiff
- Managed molecular biology & biochemistry research projects, including wet-lab and dry-lab tasks, to successfully execute 15+ experiments surrounding the Shp-2 and p52 protein
- Conducted seven surgical experiments to investigate specific HCC pathways and genes to induce tumor oncogenesis in the liver of mice and identify potential targets using NGS data analysis
- Coordinated with 10+ senior lab members to process and analyze large DNA-, RNA-, and ChIP- seq datasets to drive research on HCC pathology and the role of kinase inhibitors via R & Python
- My day-to-day responsibilities consist of receiving large datasets from our wet lab scientists or nearby wet labs and analyzing it to give them further instructions and recommendations on their on-going projects and research. I also collaborate with other bioinformaticians and the Principal Investigator in the lab to discuss more efficient and effective practices.
  
# Projects
- CSE 185: Advanced Bioinformatics Lab [findPeaks Adaptation](https://github.com/g1cole/CSE185)
  - Developed and demonstrated a multithreading Python tool that implemented ChIP-seq data and statistical analysis to find peaks using transcription factor data. It takes in a tag directory of the input genome and a control genome, for comparison, then outputs a .BED file containing the start and end position and p-value of each peak.
- BENG 183: Applied Genomic Technologies [RNA-Sequence Alignment](https://github.com/g1cole/beng183)
  - Co-presented a lecture covering the key aspects of RNA-seq Alignment and the logistics of two popular alignment tools, STAR and TopHat2. Conducted a detailed comparative analysis of the two, highlighting nuanced distinctions and uncovering the respective advantages and drawbacks of each.
- BIMM 143: Introductory Bioinformatics Lab [Find A Gene Project](https://github.com/g1cole/bimm143/blob/main/Find%20A%20Gene%20Project%20Website.pdf)
  - Selected the novel protein “Malate Dehydrogenase” from the species Panagrolaimus to analyze and compare to related sequences using MSA, heatmaps, phylogenetic trees, atomic resolution, & 3-D modeling.
