# Laboratory Experience
*Undergraduate Researcher | Dr. Feng Cancer Research Lab @ UC San Diego*
- Research specific cancer-related pathways and genes to induce and reduce tumor oncogenesis in the liver of mice by
executing NGS experiments including whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq along with conducted mice
surgical procedures
- Improved NGS library quality via utilization of NGS technologies and assays such as RNA-seq and DNA-seq and
troubleshooting the sequencing process end-to-end
- Established expertise of molecular biology & biochemistry lab skills such as cell culture; DNA, RNA & protein extraction; gene
cloning; reverse transcription; real time qPCR; BCA quantification and Western Blots
- Demonstrated fundamental knowledge of the hepatocellular carcinoma pathology and function of the kinase inhibitor in tumor
 treatment
- My day-to-day responsibilities consist of receiving large datasets from our wet lab scientists or nearby wet labs and analyzing it to give them further instructions and recommendations on their on-going projects and research. I also collaborate with other bioinformaticians and the Principal Investigator in the lab to discuss more efficient and effective practices.
