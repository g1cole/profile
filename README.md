# Laboratory Experience
*Undergraduate Researcher | Dr. Feng Cancer Research Lab @ UC San Diego*
- Enhanced NGS library quality by implementing cutting-edge technologies and assays like RNA-seq and DNA-seq,
resulting in a 40% reduction in sequencing artifacts and ensuring more reliable downstream analyses
- Reduced erroneous data by 30% and significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of bioinformatics analyses by
applying advanced data transformation and data cleansing methodologies
- Proficiently conducted molecular biology & biochemistry lab tasks, including cell culture; DNA, RNA & protein extraction;
gene cloning; reverse transcription; real time qPCR; BCA quantification and Western Blots, contributing to the successful
execution of multiple research projects
- Investigated specific cancer-related pathways and genes to induce and reduce tumor oncogenesis in the liver of mice by
executing NGS experiments, achieving a comprehensive understanding of tumor biology and identifying potential
therapeutic targets
- Acquired an in-depth understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma pathology and the role of kinase inhibitors in tumor
treatment, facilitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies with promising outcomes
- My day-to-day responsibilities consist of receiving large datasets from our wet lab scientists or nearby wet labs and analyzing it to give them further instructions and recommendations on their on-going projects and research. I also collaborate with other bioinformaticians and the Principal Investigator in the lab to discuss more efficient and effective practices.
